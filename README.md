# Traffic Volume Analysis with Bayes

![Title](https://github.com/robertdefilippi/traffic-bayes/blob/master/traffic_image.png?raw=true)

A short notebook on how to perform analysis using Bayes and monte carlo markov models.

All data was randomly generated by me, and does not accurately represent traffic in Vancouver. Traffic in Vancouver is much much worse that is depicted in this model
